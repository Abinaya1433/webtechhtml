		<p>Respected Sir,</p>
		<p>I am writing to express my interest in participating in the web technology mock interview session. As a recent graduate with a degree in Computer Science, I am eager to apply my academic knowledge of web development in a practical setting. Throughout my studies, I have developed a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am keen to further enhance my skills and understanding of modern web technologies.</p>

<p>During my academic career, I completed a few simple projects using HTML, which introduced me to the basics of web development. These projects helped me understand the fundamental principles of creating web pages and sparked my interest in learning more about web technologies. While my experience is primarily academic, I am eager to expand my skills in CSS, JavaScript, and I am committed to continuous learning and growth in this field.</p>

<p>Participating in the mock interview will provide me with valuable insights into the interview process and help identify areas for improvement. I am enthusiastic about receiving constructive feedback from experienced professionals, which will enable me to refine my approach and better present my skills and potential to prospective employers. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to demonstrate my capabilities and to learn from this valuable experience.</p>

<h3>Sincerely,</h3>
